# Lyst-V2

## laravel-task-app
A task app built in laravel and sqlite.
This repository began as one for the laravel-task-app project in West-Mec. After spending a good amount of time working on improving the project, I decided that it would make a fantastic template for my capstone project of that semester in West-Mec. Therefore, it became the second version of my first capstone called "Lyst," hence the name, Lyst-V2.

## Purpose
This project was designed to be one that lets the user create lists and keep track of them. The data the user enters is stored via databases. The user can create a to-do list of tasks and have them be displayed on a to-do list page. The user can also alter or delete specific entries in the list. Entries in the list can be modified by having their specific fields be altered to new values, though each field's value must match what the datatype of the field is.

## Technologies Used and Why
This project was created using the following technologies.
* MVC Architecture: The laravel-task-app project itself was designed to be one that taught students how MVC Architecture functioned. It ended up being ideal for the kind of webpage that uses databases to display data the user enters and modifies. I ended up turning the project template into my capstone largely due to how intuitive MVC Architecture was and how it fit perfectly with the kind of webpage I wanted to build for my capstone.
* Laravel: Again, this technology was largely used to teach us students in West-Mec about how laravel worked. Laravel was also a technology needed to make the MVC Architecture functional within the project.
* PHP: PHP is the language that we used within our Virtual Box demo projects prior to building the laravel-task-app. To make sure we understood the language properly, the instructor required that PHP was the language that we wrote our code in.
* Node.js: This technology was used largely to run the project from the console of the Visual Studio code files. The packages installed with certain commands made most of the project's functions possible.
