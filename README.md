# Lyst-V2

## laravel-task-app
A task app built in laravel and sqlite.
This repository began as one for the laravel-task-app project in West-Mec. After spending a good amount of time working on improving the project, I decided that it would make a fantastic template for my capstone project of that semester in West-Mec. Therefore, it became the second version of my first capstone called "Lyst," hence the name, Lyst-V2.

## Purpose
This project was designed to be one that lets the user create lists and keep track of them via databases. The user can create a to-do list of tasks and have them be displayed on a to-do list page. The user can also alter or delete specific entries in the list.
